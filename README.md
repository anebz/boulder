## How to contribute

If you want to contribute, see the [issues](https://github.com/anebz/boulder/issues) and write a comment saying that you want to work on it. Additionally, if you think of a new issue, feel free to add it :)

## How to add a new gym

If you know a gym that shows the occupancy data, we can add it to the app!

Please fork the repo and make your changes in `capture-data/web_scrape.py`, the scraping script. Include the new gym in the `urls` list and write a function to scrape and process the occupancy data. Then make a pull request, we will review it, make it work in the app and add the gym.

## Backend Lambda

Set up the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) directory. This requires AWS credentials.

```bash
cd capture_data/
sls --verbose
sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

Before deploying, invoke Lambda function locally:

```bash
serverless invoke local -f s3tos3
```

Deploy and invoke the Lambda function.

```bash
serverless deploy
serverless invoke -f s3tos3 --log
```

## Front-end

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) locally. Set up the AWS profile to access the dataset in AWS:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=my_profile
streamlit run app.py
```

### Front-end deployment: [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)

1. Create app in Heroku and set a name. In this case, **`bouldern`**.
2. Create `Dockerfile` with [specific streamlit commands](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/how-to-use-streamlit-in-docker/1067/2)
3. Set web and backend in `heroku.yml`
4. Create environment variables in Heroku: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `OWM_API` from [PyOWM](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm)

Log in to Heroku from the terminal

```bash
# attach project to heroku app
heroku git:remote -a bouldern
# log in with the CLI. docker must be running
heroku container:login
```

Push and release project in Heroku

```bash
# push changes to heroku
heroku container:push web
# release app
heroku container:release web
# check logs
heroku logs --tail
```

Alternatively, as the way it's set up now, you can connect Heroku to Github so that the commits to the main branch trigger a Heroku deployment.
